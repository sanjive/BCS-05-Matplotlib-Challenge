For those of you who have started the pymaceuticals homework, I wanted to clarify some things. First, instead of picking any mouse, you will use mouse ID l509 for the line and scatter plots. Second, the instructions say "Generate a bar plot showing the number of mice per time point for each treatment" This really means: generate a bar chart showing total number of mice per drug across all time points. You are simply doing a sum per drug, and you do not need to break it down by time point. (edited)
